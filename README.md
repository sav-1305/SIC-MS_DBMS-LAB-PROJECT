# INTRODUCTION
The "Startup Incubation Centre Management System" (SICMS) is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline the operations of startups, fostering an environment conducive to entrepreneurial growth and success. SICMS offers a centralized solution for managing the entire lifecycle of startups, from application and selection to mentoring and graduation. The system enables efficient and secure methods to store and display relevant data between startups, mentors, and administrators.  

## OBJECTIVE
The objective of the “Startup Incubation Centre Management Software” is to create a Startup Database Management System for secure user authentication, efficient startup profile management, and comprehensive financial tracking to enhance the incubation process and facilitate informed decisionmaking.

## SCOPE
This system will be useful for startups, mentors, and administrators, focusing on secure authentication, streamlined startup profiles, and detailed financial tracking to foster a reliable and growth-centric incubation environment.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The proposed Startup Database Management System designed to be used by a business incubation center incorporates three users: Startups, Mentors, and Administrators. User management will be incorporated to ensure secure authentication for user profiles. The system will allow startups to create and update profiles, define their project, and detail their founders and team members, and business details. Startups will be tracked to monitor the financial progress of each startup, tracking revenue and profit margins, along with investors, which can be utilised to analyse investor engagement and trends. The system will keep track of each startup's funding details to generate and analyse financial reports, providing administrators with the ability to gauge financial health and viability. These features collectively provide a reliable incubation process, fostering growth for each startup.
